#Inputting a file to this Code
To input a circuit file to, this code create a file called the .netlist file.

A spice netlist consists of lines of the following forms:

.circuit
name n1 n2 value # comment
name n1 n2 n3 n4 value # comment
name n1 n2 vname value # comment
.end
When reading, we are to neglect lines till we meet a dot command, i.e., a line starting with
a dot. If the dot command is .circuit, the following lines dene the circuit. The circuit
definition ends with a line containing .end. Note: These dot commands must have . in the
first character of the line. This distinguishes them from lines where a . comes in the middle of
the line.
The circuit definition consists of lines, each of which denes a branch of the circuit. For
instance,

name n1 n2 n3 n4 value # comment

is a branch representing a dependent source, where n1, n2 , n3 and n4 are symbolic names
representing nodes, name is the name of the element. The first letter of the name denotes the
type of element, as follows:

R - RESISTOR - OHMS
C - CAPACITOR - FARAD
L - INDUCTOR - HENRY
V - INDEPENDENT VOLTAGE SOURCE - VOLT
I - INDEPENDENT CURRENT SOURCE - AMPERE

.ac V ... frequency

This is a single line command. It will appear after the .circuit ... .end block and
specify the frequency of a voltage source.
We will also modify the way voltage source and current values are given. We will use the
following representations:

V... n1 n2 ac Vpô€€€p phase # ac voltage source
V... n1 n2 dc v # dc voltage source
